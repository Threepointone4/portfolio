In this post we will see how negetive prompt work in stable diffusion.

In the Introduction [Blog](../Introduction_to_Stable_Diffusion/index.qmd) we saw the below code snippet, which generates images from the text.

Intuition is lets say `input_text = "man in blue dress"` and this generates a output latent p1.
Now one more input called `input_text2 = "blue"` and this generates a output latent p2.
Now at a high level `p1-p2` --> an image of man in **not blue** colour.

Also similar to what we saw in Components of Stable diffusion [blog](../Building_components_of_Stable_Diffusion/index.qmd). We used to generate 2 outputs, one aligned with text and one creative. We used to combine by a logic to get the final output. 

```
pipe2 = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", revision="fp16", torch_dtype=torch.float16).to("cuda")

prompt = "a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse"

pipe2(prompt).images[0]
```

The above `pipe2` along with prompt also accept a param called **negative_prompt**.

Lets see some examples and see how good these works.

```
torch.manual_seed(1000)
prompt = "man riding blue bike with red dress"
pipe2(prompt).images[0]
```

![](p1.png)

Now lets change the color of bike with negetive prompt `blue`.

```
torch.manual_seed(1000)
pipe2(prompt, negative_prompt="blue").images[0]

```
![](p2.png)

As you can see both blue bike and blue pant has been changed.

Lets change the shirt color using negetive prompt `red`.

![](p3.png)

Let change from riding to something else using negetive prompt `riding`.

![](p4.png)

Now lets change the vehicle using negetive prompt `cycle`.

![](p5.png)


Now lets change the vehicle and the colour also using negetive prompt `blue cycle`.

![](p6.png)

Lets give completely opposite of what input prompt given and we will see what the output looks like.  negetive prompt `man riding blue bike`.

![](p7.png)

As we can see `p1 = man riding blue bike with red dress` and negetive prompt `man riding blue bike`. Yielded **girl in red dress**.

How this works? 

We saw in Previous [post](../Building_components_of_Stable_Diffusion/) a method for generating good image using **guidance_scale**. 

The equation was : 

`final_prediction = creative_predection + guidance_scale * predection_based_on_text`

Now lets add **negative_prompt** to this equation.

`final_prediction = creative_predection + guidance_scale * (predection_based_on_text - predection_based_on_negetive_text)`

So all the codes from previous post will be same. Now instead of 2 latents noise , we will doing 3.

```
#We will remove noise by X times
for i, t in enumerate(tqdm(scheduler.timesteps)):
    # As we generate for both creative and text , we will have 3 noise inputs
    input = torch.cat([latents] * 3)
    input = scheduler.scale_model_input(input, t)

    # Given to unet for prediction
    with torch.no_grad(): 
        pred = unet(input, t, encoder_hidden_states=text_embeddings).sample

    # perform guidance
    pred_uncond, pred_text, pred_neg = pred.chunk(3)
    pred = pred_uncond + guidance_scale * (pred_text - pred_neg)

    # compute the "previous" noisy sample
    latents = scheduler.step(pred, t, latents).prev_sample
```
